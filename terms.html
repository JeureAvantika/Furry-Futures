            <h1>Terms And Conditions!!</h1>
             <p>
       
                ➢ Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using <a href="index.html"> www.furryfutures.org</a> <br>
                operated by Animals Matter to Me (“us”, “we”, or “our”). This Agreement sets forth <br>
                the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the Site at 
                www.furryfutures.org <br><br>
                       
                ➢ <b>Adoption Fee: </b>  <br> Most shelters charge an adoption fee to help cover the costs of caring 
                for the animals. <br>This fee may vary depending on the shelter and the age/health of the 
                dog. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Home Visit: </b> <br> Some shelters may conduct a home visit to ensure that the environment is 
            suitable for the dog. <br>They may look for things like a secure fence, adequate space, and a 
            safe living environment. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Vaccinations and Microchipping: </b> <br>Adopted dogs are typically up to date on 
            vaccinations and may be microchipped for identification purposes. <br>Some shelters may 
            require adopters to continue with a vaccination schedule or register the microchip in 
            their name. <br><br>


            ➢ <b> Behavioural Assessments: </b> <br> Shelters may perform behavioural assessments on dogs 
            to determine their temperament and suitability for adoption. <br> They may provide 
            information on any behavioural issues and offer guidance on training and socialization. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Return Policy: </b> <br> Shelters often have a return policy in case the adoption doesn't work 
            out. <br> This could involve a trial period during which the dog can be returned if necessary, <br>
            or a commitment to take the dog back at any time if the adopter can no longer care for it. <br><br> 

            ➢ <b> Agreement to Care: </b>  <br> Adopters typically agree to provide proper care for the dog,
            including regular veterinary check-ups, <br> appropriate nutrition, exercise, and 
            companionship. They may also agree not to engage in activities <br> that could harm the dog, 
            such as neglect or abuse. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Legal Responsibilities: </b> <br> Adopters usually agree to comply with local laws and 
            regulations regarding pet ownership, <br> including licensing and leash laws. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Ownership Transfer: </b> <br> Adopters sign paperwork transferring ownership of the dog from 
            the shelter to themselves. <br> This document may include details about the dog's medical 
            history, any known behavioural issues, <br> and the terms of the adoption agreement. <br><br>

            ➢ <b> Education and Support: </b> <br> Shelters may provide educational resources and support to 
            help adopters care for their new dog. <br> This could include information on training, 
            behaviour modification, and health care. <br><br>
